        <h2>Americana</h2>
        <p>The Americana is considered a “branch up” submission, which means the arm is rotated up towards the opponent’s head to lock the shoulder and finish this submission.</p>
        <h2>Armbar</h2>
        <p>An armbar is a type of joint lock that places pressure on the elbow joint, which can force an opponent to submit.</p>
        <h2>Arm Triangle Choke</h2>
        <p>The arm triangle choke is a submission that involves trapping an opponent’s arm and neck between your arms, cutting off the blood supply to the brain.</p>
        <h2>Bow and Arrow Choke</h2>
        <p>The bow and arrow choke is a submission that involves trapping an opponent’s neck and arm between your legs, cutting off the blood supply to the brain. The attacker has control points on the upper, middle, and lower portion of the defender’s body. Also the defender is facing away from the attacker which further limits their escape options. The attacker’s legs constrain the defender’s bottom arm so that it isn’t usable and they isolate the top arm while keeping an uncomfortable pressure on the defender’s ribs. The attacker’s grip on the defender’s pants prevents the defender from being able to turn in either direction and keeps that leg off the mat to prevent bridging and shrimping.</p>
        <h2>Kimura</h2>
        <p>A Kimura is a shoulder lock that applies pressure to the shoulder joint, often leading to a “branch down” submission, which means the arm is rotated down towards the opponent’s hips to lock the shoulder and finish this submission. This is in contrast to the “branch up” variant of shoulder submission that we call the Americana,</p>
        <h2>Kneebar</h2>
        <p>A Kneebar is a leglock that can hyperextend the knee. The basic kneebar technique is similar to that of an armbar. The practitioner will trap the opponent's leg in between their legs and secure the leg with their arms so the opponent's kneecap points towards the body. The practitioner then applies pressure with their hips, forcing the opponent's leg to straighten, hyperextending the knee joint.</p>
        <h2>Omoplata</h2>
        <p>The omoplata is a shoulder lock that is performed by placing one of your legs over your opponent’s shoulder and under their armpit, then using your legs to apply pressure to their shoulder joint.</p>
        <h2>Rear Naked Choke</h2>
        <p>The rear naked choke is a submission that involves trapping an opponent’s neck between your arms, cutting off the blood supply to the brain.</p>
        <h2>Triangle Choke</h2>
        <p>The triangle choke is a submission that involves trapping an opponent’s head and arm between your legs, cutting off the blood supply to the brain.</p>
        <h2>Straight Ankle Lock</h2>
        <p>The straight ankle lock is a submission that involves applying pressure to the ankle joint, often leading to a “branch down” submission. It is typically performed using the legs to isolate one of the opponent's legs, and placing the opponent's foot in the armpit, while holding the foot with the forearm at the lower part of the opponent's calf, usually at the achilles tendon. By leveraging the hips forward, the foot becomes forcefully plantar flexed, hence creating a potent joint lock on the ankle.</p>
