    <h2>Hello there, this is Shujun &#128075;</h2>
    <p>I'm currently an one srtipe white belt BJJ trainer. You may ask "what is BJJ?" Hmmm great question &#129300;. I'm still trying to answer this question by keeping going for rolls and getting smashed haha. </p>
    <p>Okay, here's what Google told me: BJJ is a martial art and combat sport that teaches a smaller person how to defend themselves against a larger adversary by using leverage and proper technique. The Gracie family, the founders of BJJ, modified judo and traditional Japanese jujutsu to create the art.</p>
    <p>Sounds cool, right? &#128526; As long as you keep the balance of your own force, you will rock like Master Yoda.</p>
    <p>So, I'm here to share my BJJ journey with you. I'll be posting my training diary, BJJ dictionary, and my favorite BJJ videos. I hope you enjoy them!</p>
